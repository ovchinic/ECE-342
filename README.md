Project: Contactless Infrared Temperature Sensor<br />

Project Showcase: https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/project-showcase/projects/?id=ot5eDocNVREMYnlE<br />

Database_SourceCode: This source code uses libraries and APIs to allow the external database on Google Sheets to communicate with the Arduino Nano<br />
Microcontroller_SourceCode: This source code uses libraries to read the data incoming from the infrared sensor (MLX90614) and output that data to an OLED display (SSD1306). It will also receive serial communication from the Database_SourceCode.py script that will begin the reading. Must be ran on a local machine with the project device for serial communication.<br />
